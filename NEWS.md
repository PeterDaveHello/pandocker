Major Upgrades
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This new version is now based on Debian 10 buster (instead of Stretch) with
pandoc 2.11 and the version 2.0 of the eisvogel template. We have done careful
regression tests but these changes may introduce minor changes in the rendered
output of your documents. Please open a ticket if you notice a problematic
behaviour.


Support for Arabic, Persian, Hindi and CJK languages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The docker image has now a new variant named `full` that will included
non-european fonts, especially the complete [Noto font]. This font family is
designed to support all languages.

[Noto font]: https://www.google.com/get/noto/

We also included latex font packages such as [devanagari] for Hindi and
[farsiweb] for Persian. Right-to-Left typesetting is also supported.

[devanagari]: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/devanagari
[farsiweb]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/fonts-farsiweb

To use these fonts, you can simply define the `mainfont` variable inside the
markdown front-matter or via the pandoc command line with the `-v` (or
`--variable` option) :

```shell
docker run [...] dalibo/pandocker [...] hindi.md -o hindi.pdf -v mainfont='Lohit Devanagari'
```

For Noto:

```shell
docker run [...] dalibo/pandocker [...] foo.md -o foo.pdf -v mainfont='Noto Sans'
```

**IMPORTANT:** The `full` docker image size is approx. 800MB whereas the regular
is "only" 320 MB. We recommend that you use the `full` variant only when needed
and prefer the regular variant for basic use cases.

The support for Hindi and Persian was sponsored by the [OWASP Foundation]. Many
thanks to them ! Many thanks also to @iapellaniz and @vvishnyakov who contributed
to the release.

[OWASP Foundation]: https://owasp.org/
[Noto font]: https://www.google.com/get/noto/
[devanagari]: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/devanagari
[farsiweb]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/fonts-farsiweb

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

depencies on your machine.

For instance to generate an EPUB file from a markdown source, you can simply

```

This image is available under BSD Licence and it has 2 main tags:

* `dalibo/pandocker:latest` is the development version

You can also retrieve older versions by their version number:

* The [eisvogel] template has been upgraded to 1.4

Many thanks to @colindean and @DigitalTravelDuck for their contributions to these
features !


Using pandocker with pipes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to run the pandocker image as a 'black box' by passing the
source file through a pipe and collecting the result on the standard output.

For example:

```
$ cat foo.md | docker run --rm -i dalibo/pandocker -t pdf > foo.pdf
```

This is useful if you want to use pandocker in a stream or when you don't want
to mount a docker volume. However, this method will not work if the source
document contains images or includes external files...


How to upgrade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```console
docker pull dalibo/pandocker:stable
```

* Docker Hub : <https://hub.docker.com/r/dalibo/pandocker/>



What's new in version 18.11 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Eisvogel, a new template for everyone

We're now shipping a latex template inside the image so that you can produce a
nice PDF without installing anything.

The template is called [eisvogel] and you can use it simply by adding
`--template=eisvogel` to your compilation lines:

```
docker run [...] --pdf-engine=xelatex --template=eisvogel foo.md -o foo.pdf
```

[eisvogel]: https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template

### End of pandoc 1.x automatic support

Since version 18.03, we're using Pandoc 2 and starting with this version some
old parameters will no longer be supported. You need to check your compilation
lines and make the following changes :

* replace `--latex-engine` by `--pdf-engine`
* replace `--no-tex-ligatures` by `--from=markdown-smart`

As an alternative, you can also changer the entrypoint and call the `pandoc1.sh`
compatibility wrapper

```
docker run [...] --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/pandoc1.sh [...]
```

### Easy PDF with WeasyPrint

We're now publishing a dedicated image including [WeasyPrint], alternative pdf
engine that generates PDF files from using HTML/CSS templates.

[WeasyPrint]: https://weasyprint.org/samples/

To use this template, you can simply use tag `weasy`:

```
docker run [...] dalibo/pandocker:weasy \
                    --pdf-engine=weasyprint` \
                    --pdf-engine-opt="--stylesheet template.css" \
                    --template=template.html \
                    foo.md \
                    -o foo.pdf
```

We're currently testing this new engine, please send us feedback if you're
using it too !

* Docker Hub : <https://hub.docker.com/r/dalibo/pandocker/>



What's new in version 18.06 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pandocker spricht Deutsch

We added support for german charset.


### Beware of for depracated parameters

Since version 18.03, we're using Pandoc 2 and it introduced 2 incompatibilities:

* `--latex-engine` is now named `--pdf-engine`
* `--no-tex-ligatures` is replaced by `--from=markdown-smart`

We added a wrapper that automatically supports both pandoc 1.x and
2.x parameters, but in the long run you should consider updating your
compilation flags.


How to upgrade

```
docker pull dalibo/pandocker:stable
```

Pandocker 18.03 is out !
================================================================================

What is this ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pandocker is a docker image containing a complete document production toolchain.
It allows you to generate slides and documents using `pandoc`, but without
installing the required depencies on your machine.

For instance to generate an EPUB file from a markdown source, you can simply
type:

```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/pandoc dalibo/pandocker:stable test.md -o test.epub
```

This image is available under BSD Licence and it is designed to work without
specific templates.

The project has 2 main branchs:

* `dalibo/pandocker:stable` should be used in production ( = 18.03 )
* `dalibo/pandocker:latest` is the development version

You can also retrieve images by their version number : `dalibo/pandocker:18.03`,
`dalibo/pandocker:17.12`, etc.

What's new in version 18.03 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### We switched to Pandoc 2

Pandoc 2 was released in october 2017 and brings tons of great new features.
It also introduce a few incompatibilities as some parameters have been abruptly
renamed:

* `--latex-engine` is now named `--pdf-engine`
* `--no-tex-ligatures` is replaced by `--from=markdown-smart`

Hopefully we added a wrapper that automatically supports both pandoc 1.x and
2.x parameters, but in the long run you should consider updating your
compilation flags.


### We lost weight

The size of the previous image was 1.2GB (uncompressed). We reduced this to
735MB. We stripped down the image by removing a lot of unused LaTeX packages.
If you're missing one, please fill a bug report here :

<https://github.com/dalibo/pandocker/issues>

### Beamer is Back !

We restored the beamer export mode. You can simply get PDF slides like this:

```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/pandoc  dalibo/pandocker:stable -t beamer foo.md - o foo.beamer.pdf
```
